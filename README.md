CCLI -- common console interface

AIM:
	Set up a layer that spread all the normal switches.
	You can getversion(get the network device system version), do not care the switch comes from huawei or h3c or juniper or cisco.
	

2014.8.14 Add the file sw.py. So you can use the sw.py instead of all of the other python files.
